      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a final year B.Tech student majoring at Electronics &amp;amp; Electrical Engineering with minors in Computer Science &amp;amp; Engineering at IIT Guwahati. I work on problems at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning, finding new approaches and methods to combine both and solve challenging Robotics problems. With just months remaining for my gradution, I did two summer research intenships in 2019 and 2018, where I worked with Prof. Balaraman Ravindran at RISE Labs, IIT Madras and earlier with Dr. Venkat Natarajan at Intel Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother advised me to aim for the stars, and that is exactly what I do with my telescope in my free time. Also, I was a 2x National Champion &amp;amp; 5x consecutive State champion in my 9 years of Roller Skating career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also love trekking, solo-trips, cycling trips &amp;amp; going to unknown places. Although I don&amp;rsquo;t do it that often anymore, please do ping me if you got some good trekking plans. :)&lt;/p&gt;
