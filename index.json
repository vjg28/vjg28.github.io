Following my research interests, I did both summer research intenships in 2019 and 2018 in the field of Deep RL and Imitation Learning, where I worked under Prof. Balaraman Ravindran at RISE Labs, IIT Madras and earlier with Dr. Venkat Natarajan at Intel Labs.\nAim for the stars- summarises my free time I spend with my telescope. Coming up to sports, I stood out as a two times National Champion \u0026amp; 5 times consecutive State champion in my nine years of Roller Skating career.\nI also love trekking, solo-trips, cycling trips \u0026amp; going to unknown places. Although I don\u0026rsquo;t do it that often anymore, please do ping me if you got some excellent trekking plans. :)\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://vjg28.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a final year B.Tech student with majors in Electronics \u0026amp; Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Science \u0026amp; Engineering at IIT Guwahati.
